To compare CPU performance of different implementations of the same algorithm, 
or to compare performance of different algorithms that perform a certain task, 
we may need to measure the CPU cycles incurred for the implementation(s)
and algorithm(s) concerned. Piece-by-piece comparison of individual steps
in an algorithm may also be done in a simulation module, to suggest which
alternative implementation has lower CPU overhead than others.

In this document, we present collated information regarding how-to use the
model-specific TSC register to count the number
of ticks or CPU cycles spent for any target set of instructions. For ease of 
use, we make available snippets of code that can be pasted into existing
code to quickly perform measurement. We also present a
sample use-case at the end, of measuring CPU cycles incurred for MD5 hashing
and outline our learnings.
